# PolynomialCalculator
Takes polynomials as input from text file and performs operations on them

School Project

Can take two polynomials and add/subtract/multiply them.
The polynomials are input through a textfile with the format:
[operation] <br>
[Poly 1] <br>
[Poly 2] <br>

Note: The format of the polynomials is a string of numbers separated by spaces. The first number out of a pair is the coefficient,
while the second number in a pair is the exponent of x.

Also should be noted that I did not write the DoublyLinkedList.java class or the List interface. Those were provided for the project by
my professor, Dr. Joseph Svitak.
